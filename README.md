# Instruction Flow Expander (IFE) Architecture

## üß† Overview

The Instruction Flow Expander (IFE) is a microarchitecture component designed to optimize the execution of predominantly sequential programs. It intelligently exploits implicit parallelism through dynamic and safe duplication of instruction blocks, enabling parallel execution on idle cores. The architecture ensures correctness via conditional commits, resulting in notable performance gains, especially for applications that lack explicit parallelism.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Components

| Module              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `IFE_BlockQueue`     | Stores newly decoded instruction blocks awaiting analysis                  |
| `IFE_DependenceChecker` | Performs conservative dependency checks (RAW, WAR, WAW)               |
| `IFE_DispatchUnit`   | Dispatches duplicated blocks to available cores, considering load          |
| `IFE_Monitor`        | Tracks core state to identify parallelism opportunities                    |
| `IFE_CommitUnit`     | Compares parallel execution results and performs conditional commits       |
| `IFE_ResourceMonitor`| Oversees system resource usage and disables IFE under critical contention  |
| `IFE_BypassPath`     | Provides a serial fallback path when duplication isn‚Äôt viable              |
